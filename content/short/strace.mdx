I was ready to continue reading my book. Double-clicked and BAM! The not so great epdf-viewer popped up. Not this time fellow.
So like every average linux man/woman/etc I decided to change the default application for pdf files.
I alread had foxit-reader installed. So I knew it was oppening it via xdg-open. The xdg-open relies on the xdg-mime to query and determine the default application for a given file type.
But there is a catch. I didn't know what flags to pass. So like my professor always said: "When in doubt, man it".

```
man xdg-mime
```

And there it was. `xdg-mime default application mimetype(s)`. Only one teeny tiny problem. What is the mimetype here?
Is it file extension? or what we web developers called the content-type? It's not application/pdf right?
So if the epdf-viewer is oppening it, there should be a key/val somewhre. but where?

there

```
> xdg-mime query default image/png
viewnior.desktop
```

So I have command is 100% doing some IO. So I decided to strace it.

```
> strace -e file xdg-mime query default image/png
...
newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/tur1ng/.config/mimeapps.list", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=2399, ...}, 0) = 0
...
```

Great. So a simple cat-greping should do the trick.

```
> cat ~/.config/mimeapps.list | grep pdf
application/pdf=epdfview.desktop;
```

Aha, I was right. To be honest the second I saw image/png I knew it was the same as the content-type. But regardless, I was right.

So let's xdg-mime it.

```
> xdg-mime default foxitreader.desktop application/pdf
```

Beautiful. I can now read my book in peace.

Turns out xdg-mime accepts another flag. Of course it does. `xdg-mime query filetype filename` and it will return the mimetype.

```
>  xdg-mime query filetype ./anything.pdf
application/pdf
```
